# Tracing calls through backend components

## Overview

Implement distributed tracing across Jitsi's backend components to improve observability and debugging.

## Description

This project aims to implement distributed tracing using modern observability tools, allowing developers and operators
to follow a call's path through the entire backend stack. This will significantly improve debugging capabilities,
performance analysis, and understanding of system behavior.

## Expected outcomes

* Integration of distributed tracing framework (e.g., OpenTelemetry) across Jitsi backend components.
* Trace correlation between JVB, Jicofo, and Prosody for individual calls.
* Visualization of call flows through components.
* Documentation on how to use tracing for debugging and performance analysis.
* Sample dashboards and queries for common debugging scenarios.
