# PTZ camera support via WebRTC constraints

## Overview

Add support for Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera controls in Jitsi Meet using WebRTC constraints.

## Description

This project aims to add PTZ camera support to Jitsi Meet, enabling users with compatible hardware to control their
cameras directly from the meeting interface. This would be particularly valuable for professional broadcasting,
education, and hybrid meeting scenarios where PTZ cameras are commonly used.

## Expected outcomes

* Detection and discovery of PTZ-capable cameras
* UI controls for pan, tilt, and zoom operations
* Optional: External API methods for programmatic PTZ control

## Skills / Technologies

JavaScript, TypeScript, React, WebRTC

## Possible mentors

Jaya Allamsetty, Saúl Ibarra Corretgé

## Expected project size
