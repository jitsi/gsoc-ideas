# Document Picture-in-Picture for browser meetings

## Overview

Implement Document Picture-in-Picture API support for enhanced browser-based meeting experiences.

## Description

Modern browsers now support the Document Picture-in-Picture API, which allows entire documents (not just video elements) to be displayed in always-on-top windows.

window that stays on top while they work in other applications.

## Expected outcomes

* Implementation of Document Picture-in-Picture API in Jitsi Meet
* Customizable PiP window layouts (compact view, gallery view, etc.)
* Interactive controls within PiP window (mute, video toggle, chat, etc.)
