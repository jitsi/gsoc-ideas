Think about preparing a proposal, but *do NOT share any drafts publically to avoid being plagiarized*. We don't have the resources to review drafts anyway, so please do *NOT* include them in your introduction email.

Use of AI/LLMs for project proposals should be limited to language and grammar corrections only. Your proposal should be concise, well-organized, and demonstrate your genuine interest in the project.
