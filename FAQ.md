# FAQ for potential GSoC contributors

## 1. Should I reach out to mentors before the official mentoring period begins?
We receive a high volume of questions, and unfortunately, we are unable to provide one-on-one mentoring before the official GSoC mentoring period starts. However, we encourage you to explore our existing ideas and resources to get started independently.

## 2. Where should I look for existing project ideas and resources?
All potential project ideas are listed in our [GSoC Ideas repository](https://github.com/jitsi/gsoc-ideas/tree/master/2025). Additionally, you can explore past contributions, discussions, and documentation to understand our work better.

## 3. What if I have a question that is not answered in the available resources?
If you cannot find the information you need after exploring our resources, you may open an issue in the [GSoC Ideas repository](https://github.com/jitsi/gsoc-ideas/tree/master/2025). Please make sure to describe your question clearly and include what you have already researched.

## 4. I have a project idea that is not listed. Can I still apply?
Yes! We welcome bespoke ideas as long as they align with our projectâ€™s goals. If you have an idea, we strongly recommend reaching out early so that we can review a draft of your proposal before you submit your final application. This ensures that your idea is feasible and aligns with our needs.

## 5. What is the best way to contact the team?
If you need to get in touch, please reach out to the org admins.
