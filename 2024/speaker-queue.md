# Speaker Queue

## Overview

Develop a user interface component that organizes the set of participants that are ready to speak into a queue.

## Description

The [Jitsi Meet](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/) system allows participants to raise their hand to indicate that they are ready to speak.

one to speak.

## Expected outcomes
* User interface components that organize the participants with raised hand into a queue.
