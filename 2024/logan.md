# Jitsi Log Analyser

## Overview

Develop tools that help with analysis of log files from the various [Jitsi Meet]() components.

## Description

The [Jitsi Meet]() system comprises of multiple components, each with their own log file and format (nginx, 
prosody, jicofo, jitsi-videobridge, jitsi-meet). Analysing these logs while debugging can be challenging and we
don't have good tools to do so.

We want to develop programming tools that can be used interactively to search, filter, plot and otherwise handle
events from the various log files. One way to implement this could be as a jupyter notebook with appropriate functions.

## Expected outcomes
* A set of tools to help search, filter, plot events from the various log files in [Jitsi Meet]()

Python, Jupyter, bash, or other suitable technologies chosen by the student.
