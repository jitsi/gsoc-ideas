# Jitsi Meet React Native SDK

## Overview

Create a React Native SDK for Jitsi Meet.

## Description

While the Jitsi Meet mobile apps are written with React Native, the SDK is designed to target native apps, not other React Native apps.
We have seen an uptick in people wanting to integrate in Jitsi Meet into existing RN apps, so having a dedicated SDK is the goal.

## Expected ooutcomes

A working RN SDK which uses the existing code but makes it consumable by other RN apps.

## Skills

React / React Native. Some native mobile development would be good to have though not necessary.

## Possible mentors

@saghul, @calinteodor, @tmoldovan8x8

## Expected project size

175 hours. 

## Difficulty

Medium.
