# Pinned Chat Feature

## Overview

The idea behind the project is to develop a pinned-chat feature within the current chat window in a Jitsi-meet video call. The objective is to allow the moderator of the meet to pin important public chat messages that all the participants can look up at any time during the meet which ensures that all participants in the professional setting are on the same page. The addition of breakout rooms and simple polls feature last year has improved Jitsi for educations usage. Implementing a pinned chat feature will be a great addition for the userbase which uses Jitsi for educational as well as professional/work-related meets.
