# JVB Prometheus Stats

## Overview

Update the JVB stats to also report in prometheus scraping format

## Description

While the JVB currently supports operational stats via JSON format, the prometheus format has become a more standard way of scraping metrics from services. 
This project is to add an additional REST endpoint which sends back operational stats in prometheus format.

## Expected outcomes
The JVB will be able to be scraped via a prometheus stats collector or via other scrapers which support this format.  
A query on the local stats port to /prometheus should result in all general stats being dumped.
