# Chat Moderation & Editing

## Overview

Enhance chat functionality with advanced moderation and editing features.

## Description

Improve [Jitsi](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/)'s basic chat by adding moderation tools and editing capabilities. Currently, moderators have limited control, as the chat lacks features like message editing, deletion, and reporting. This project aims to improve usability and moderation.

## Expected outcomes

Cover features such as the following:
* Message Control for Moderators – Ability to delete and redact messages, mute and remove participants directly from the chat interface.
* User Moderation Tools – Moderators can ban users from messaging, issue warnings, shadow ban, and remove participants from the chat.
* User Reporting System – Allow users to report messages or participants for review.
* User Message Editing – Users can edit their own messages with version history.
* Message Search – Enable users to search chat history efficiently.

Extra points for a challenge:
* Threaded Replies – Improve conversation structure with message threading.
