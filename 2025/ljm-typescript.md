# lib-jitsi-meet goes TypeScript

## Overview

[lib-jitsi-meet](https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet) is the low level JavaScript library that takes care of all
signalling and media negotiation for Jitsi Meet. It's partially written in TypeScript and now is a good time to make that
100%!

## Description

lib-jitsi-meet (LJM) is the low level library that was spun off the Jitsi Meet project so it can also be consumed standalone.
Over time parts of it were migrated to TS but it's not 100% there.

We'd like to fully move to TS so we can better document its public API and typings, and get a better development experience by
using the generated type information.

## Expected outcomes

* lib-jitsi-meet in TypeScript
* Automated typings package generation and publication
