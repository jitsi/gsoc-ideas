# Picture-in-Picture for iOS

## Overview

Jitsi Meet is available for mobile platforms on Android and iOS. Android already has a native Picture-in-Picture (PiP) implementation;
this project aims to provide equivalent functionality on iOS.

## Description

The Android and iOS Jitsi Meet apps have feature parity, but sometimes due to platform differences features are not available
on one of the platforms. This is the case of PiP in iOS. Thanksfully support for it was added to react-native-webrtc, so this
project is about integrating that support into the Jitsi Meet iOS app.

## Expected outcomes

* iOS app with support for PiP
* Background camera support for iOS
