# Integrated AI services with Skynet

## Overview

Provide an integrated experience across Jitsi Meet, Jigasi and Skynet for an integrated AI services approach that includes meeting transcriptions
and summaries.

## Description

Jitsi Meet already has support for AI assisted transcriptions and summaries by combining [Jigasi](https://github.com/jitsi/jigasi)
and [Skynet](https://github.com/jitsi/skynet). There is, however no out-of-the-box way to set it up. This project aims to provide that experience
with some Docker docnfiguration and a new small full-stack solution to glue all the services together.

* New Docker configuration to run Skynet
* New backend service to store and process transcriptions
* New froendend service to browser past meetings history
