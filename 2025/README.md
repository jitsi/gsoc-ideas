# Interested in applying for a project?

Make sure to read the [GSoC advice pages](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice/) to see how to get started, and check out the [Jitsi handbook](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/) to get yourself more familiarized with Jitsi.

Think about preparing a draft proposal, but note that:
* The participating organizations have not been announced yet, so we don't know whether Jitsi will participate this year.
* Proposals or drafts shouldn't be shared publically to avoid being plagiarized. Stay tuned on details on how to share drafts with the Jitsi team privately.
