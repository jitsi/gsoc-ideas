# Meetings stats with rtcstats

## Overview

Provide an integrated way for people self-hosting Jitsi Meet to have an insight into their meeting stats with [rtcstats](https://github.com/jitsi/rtcstats-server).

## Description

With rtcstats one can get lots of information about meeting quality, logs, etc. It's what we've been using in production
for quite a while. The project is fully open source, but there is no simple way for self-hosters to deploy in their own premises.
This project aims to make that job easier by providing an integrated approach.

## Expected outcomes

* New MongoDB connector for rtcstats
* Integration with the Docker setup

## Skills / Technologies

JavaScript, TypeScript, MongoDB (not necessary), Docker

## Possible mentors

Saúl Ibarra Corretgé, Andrei Gavrilescu

## Expected project size

Medium (175 hours)

## Difficulty
