# Whiteboard Improvements

## Overview

Further develop whiteboard capabilities

## Description

The current [Jitsi](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/) whiteboard integration is a fork of Excalidraw. Participants can only share smart objects during collaboration and there is a limit in place to limit memory overload.

## Expected outcomes

* File Upload Support – Enable users to upload and share files within the whiteboard.
* Upgrade to Socket.IO 4 – Improve performance and compatibility by updating the underlying real-time communication library.
* Migrate to a Newer Excalidraw – Upgrade to the latest version for better features and stability.
* Improve WebSocket Connections – Optimize packet size during real-time collaboration.
